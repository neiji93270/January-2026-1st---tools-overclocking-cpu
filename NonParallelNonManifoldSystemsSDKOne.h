//the non parallel behaviour of a system tuning at 5250 V or less can be ploted
//as a sub holomorph space as a vizualised non ploted previous state. This pattern seems the only one in a SDK.
//to enforce SDK for cpu, we need to commit many psh commands if the voltage increase. So we canot loss datas.
//The best thing would not be to normalize datas but signals that can be rendered in laptop or pc screens !
